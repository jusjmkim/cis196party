# CIS 196 Party

## Description
Students can submit requests for help by filling in the form.

## Background
This site was made for students enrolled in CIS 196 to request help during
PennApps 2015f.

## Technology
This app is built on Sinatra and Sendgrid for email.

## Usage
Because this app uses dotenv to manage Sendgrid credentials, a `.env` file needs
to be created with the appropriate username and API key.
Go to [www.cis196.party](www.cis196.party) and fill it out!
